The following command will list all files from `D:\AnObsidianVault\_resources` which are not referenced by `*.md` files found in `D:\AnObsidianVault`.
Remove `--dry-run` to delete the files.
Also try `orphan-md.exe --help`.

```
orphan-md.exe --what D:\AnObsidianVault\_resources --where D:\AnObsidianVault --dry-run
```
